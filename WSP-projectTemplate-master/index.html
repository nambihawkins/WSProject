			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Nambi and I am a Web Design and Development student. My goal this month will be to sharpen the skills I have learned so far in my degree program. This page will be used to document and display my progress in hopes of getting feedback that will help me in not only classes to come, but the real world.</p>

				<h2>Header</h2>
				<a href="components/1/Header.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/1/Header.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>I haven't had much practice with adding icons into a design, so I hope to learn a bit more about that. Another issue I have is floating. In this header the contact information is floated to the left and the search bar is floated to the right. I'd to learn how to float multiple items and clear items that aren't meant to be floated.</p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>Every "good" web site has some form of navigation. Usually that navigation is found in the header. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to create a functioning and presentable header. It will be the first thing a visitor looks for when opening a page.</p>

				<h2>Featured: Main Attractions</h2>
				<a href="components/2/Feature.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/2/Feature.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>Another instance of floating, yet this time there are 4 items being floated in the same row. I like how the circle image is overlaying the background for the text. I looked at the code for this one, but I still don't understand how it is done so that all elements are symmetrical.</p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>Every site has a "learn more" section where their visitors can click on one of the main topics on the page to learn more. Usually these topics are what the author/company has to offer the customer/visitor.</p>

			<div class="component-3">
				<h2>CTA</h2>
				<a href="components/3/CTA.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/3/CTA.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>There's a strategy behind where to place a CTA that I'm still learning. I know that it should be one of the first things a user notices. First of all, I'd like to practice creating a CTA button and designing it. </p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>The call to action is supposed to stand out with out clashing or distracting the user too much. The CTA is the most important part of a site because it allows the user to carry through the task that the site is advertising.</p>

			<div class="component-4">
				<h2>Blog Feed</h2>
				<a href="components/4/Blog.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/4/Blog.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>I'd like to learn what the benefit of a blog feed is. I'm starting to see more and more of them on websites now, and I'm starting to wonder if they're a requirement or just an extra means of communication to the users. What are the components that make up a blog feed?</p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>As a web designer/developer, it is my job to keep current with all social media mediums. A blog could be used as an extension of the website. I've seen Denny's use tumblr to connect on a different level withe their customers and fans. Now just about every company has a facebook, twitter, instagram, tumblr. Blog sites that typically don't have as much to do with their product as their website does, but is used just to communicate and entice audiences on more of a personal level.</p>

				<h2>Footer</h2>
				<a href="components/5/Footer.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/5/Footer.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>I'd like to learn the main purpose for a footer. I understand how to create one and I have  good idea of all that's supposed to go into it, but maybe if I understood the purpose a little bit better then I'd be able to perfect it. If it's supposed to be a reiteration of the navigation at the top of the page then why not lock the navigation to the top of the screen when scrolling, or have a return to top button on every web page?</p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>A good bit, if not every, website has a footer. Most times the footer is just a reiteration of the main navigation, and also gives some basic contact information as well as the copy right info. Because a footer is so common, I'd say it is a required part of a web design.</p>
