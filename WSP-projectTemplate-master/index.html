			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Nambi and I am a Web Design and Development student. My goal this month will be to sharpen the skills I have learned so far in my degree program. This page will be used to document and display my progress in hopes of getting feedback that will help me in not only classes to come, but the real world.</p>

				<h2>Header</h2>
				<a href="components/1/Header.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/1/Header.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>I haven't had much practice with adding icons into a design, so I hope to learn a bit more about that. Another issue I have is floating. In this header the contact information is floated to the left and the search bar is floated to the right. I'd to learn how to float multiple items and clear items that aren't meant to be floated.</p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>Every "good" web site has some form of navigation. Usually that navigation is found in the header. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to create a functioning and presentable header. It will be the first thing a visitor looks for when opening a page.</p>

				<h2>Featured: Main Attractions</h2>
				<a href="components/2/Feature.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/2/Feature.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>Another instance of floating, yet this time there are 4 items being floated in the same row. I like how the circle image is overlaying the background for the text. I looked at the code for this one, but I still don't understand how it is done so that all elements are symmetrical.</p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>Every site has a "learn more" section where their visitors can click on one of the main topics on the page to learn more. Usually these topics are what the author/company has to offer the customer/visitor.</p>

				<h2>CTA</h2>
				<a href="components/3/CTA.png" target="_blank"><img src="components/3/CTA.png"></img></a>
				<h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
				<p>There's a strategy behind where to place a CTA that I'm still learning. I know that it should be one of the first things a user notices. First of all, I'd like to practice creating a CTA button and designing it. </p>
				<h3>Relation to degree program</h3>
				<p>The call to action is supposed to stand out with out clashing or distracting the user too much. The CTA is the most important part of a site because it allows the user to carry through the task that the site is advertising.</p>
